"""Deterministic route/dispose step — code disposes what the LLM proposes (goal 5).

The classifier returns a `RouterClassification`; THIS module decides what happens
and performs (or withholds) the write. The safety contract lives in router.md:

- **LLM-proposes-code-disposes:** no write lives in the classifier; every write is here.
- **Insert-only blast radius:** the only Google writes reachable from routing are
  `create_task` (content) + `reschedule` (the g4a date path) for tasks, and
  `append_note` (goal 7, insert-only into the notes Doc) for notes. The router NEVER
  calls `delete_task`, the complete/uncomplete status write, `update_content`, or any
  Docs delete/overwrite — it is *not* a sanctioned `delete_task` caller (writes.md).
- **Confidence gate / schema gate / allowed-destination gate:** below threshold, or
  `unknown`/`event`, never auto-writes — it goes to the review queue.
- **Route-once:** routing flips `routing_state` off `UNROUTED`, so a re-run no-ops.

Goal 8: routing is per-user. `route_entry` takes the current `user` + their live
`creds`; every Google call uses those creds, the notes Doc is the user's own
(auto-bootstrapped via `settings_svc`), and every scratch/review row is user-scoped.
